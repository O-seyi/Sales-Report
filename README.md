Organizations often struggle to efficiently monitor and analyze their sales performance due to scattered data, outdated reporting methods, and a lack of real-time visibility. Traditional reporting systems are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack interactive features, making it difficult for decision-makers to derive actionable insights.
